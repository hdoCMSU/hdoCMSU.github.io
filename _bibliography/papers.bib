  abstract    = {Purpose Cardiac motion is a dominant source of physiological noise (PN) in myocardial arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion imaging. This study investigates the sensitivity to heart rate variation (HRV) of double-gated myocardial ASL compared with the more widely used single-gated method. Methods Double-gating and single-gating were performed on 10 healthy volunteers (n = 10, 3F/7M; age, 23–34 years) and eight heart transplant recipients (n = 8, 1F/7M; age, 26–76 years) at rest in the randomized order. Myocardial blood flow (MBF), PN, temporal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and HRV were measured. Results HRV ranged from 0.2 to 7.8 bpm. Double-gating PN did not depend on HRV, while single-gating PN increased with HRV. Over all subjects, double-gating provided a significant reduction in global PN (from 0.20 ± 0.15 to 0.11 ± 0.03 mL/g/min; P = 0.01) and per-segment PN (from 0.33 ± 0.23 to 0.21 ± 0.12 mL/g/min; P {\textless} 0.001), with significant increases in global temporal SNR (from 11 ± 8 to 18 ± 8; P = 0.02) and per-segment temporal SNR (from 7 ± 4 to 11 ± 12; P {\textless} 0.001) without significant difference in measured MBF. Conclusion Single-gated myocardial ASL suffers from reduced temporal SNR, while double-gated myocardial ASL provides consistent temporal SNR independent of HRV.

  abstract    = {Purpose To determine the feasibility of measuring increases in myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) on a per-segment basis using arterial spin labeled (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with adenosine vasodilator stress in normal human myocardium. Materials and Methods Myocardial ASL scans at rest and during adenosine infusion were incorporated into a routine 3T MR adenosine-induced vasodilator stress protocol and were performed in 10 healthy human volunteers. Myocardial ASL was performed using single-gated flow-sensitive alternating inversion recovery (FAIR) tagging and balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) imaging at 3T. A T2-prep blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) SSFP sequence was used to concurrently assess segmental myocardial oxygenation with BOLD signal intensity (SI) percent change in the same subjects. Results There was a statistically significant difference between MBF measured by ASL at rest (1.75 ± 0.86 ml/g/min) compared to adenosine stress (4.58 ± 2.14 ml/g/min) for all wall segments (P {\textless} 0.0001), yielding a per-segment MPR of 3.02 ± 1.51. When wall segments were divided into specific segmental myocardial perfusion territories (ie, anteroseptal, anterior, anterolateral, inferolateral, inferior, and inferoseptal), the differences between rest and stress regional MBF for each territory remained consistently statistically significant (P {\textless} 0.001) after correcting for multiple comparisons. Conclusion This study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring MBF and MPR on a segmental basis by single-gated cardiac ASL in normal volunteers. Second, this study demonstrates the feasibility of performing the ASL sequence and T2-prepared SSFP BOLD imaging during a single adenosine infusion.

  abstract    = {Purpose To apply deep convolution neural network to the segmentation task in myocardial arterial spin labeled perfusion imaging and to develop methods that measure uncertainty and that adapt the convolution neural network model to a specific false-positive versus false-negative tradeoff. Methods The Monte Carlo dropout U-Net was trained on data from 22 subjects and tested on data from 6 heart transplant recipients. Manual segmentation and regional myocardial blood flow were available for comparison. We consider 2 global uncertainty measures, named “Dice uncertainty” and “Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty,” which were calculated with and without the use of manual segmentation, respectively. Tversky loss function with a hyperparameter β was used to adapt the model to a specific false-positive versus false-negative tradeoff. Results The Monte Carlo dropout U-Net achieved a Dice coefficient of 0.91 ± 0.04 on the test set. Myocardial blood flow measured using automatic segmentations was highly correlated to that measured using the manual segmentation (R2 = 0.96). Dice uncertainty and Monte Carlo dropout uncertainty were in good agreement (R2 = 0.64). As β increased, the false-positive rate systematically decreased and false-negative rate systematically increased. Conclusion We demonstrate the feasibility of deep convolution neural network for automatic segmentation of myocardial arterial spin labeling, with good accuracy. We also introduce 2 simple methods for assessing model uncertainty. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to adapt the convolution neural network model to a specific false-positive versus false-negative tradeoff. These findings are directly relevant to automatic segmentation in quantitative cardiac MRI and are broadly applicable to automatic segmentation problems in diagnostic imaging.},

It has been observed that both infarcted and remote myocardial territories may exhibit impaired myocardial blood flow (MBF) patterns associated with an abnormal vasodilator response. Arterial spin labeled (ASL) CMR is a novel non-contrast technique that can quantitatively measure MBF.
